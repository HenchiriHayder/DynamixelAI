# Interactive Dynamixel Robot

The project is to create a robot that interacts with people in the room. To develop the project I used two main addons:
- [ofxDynamixel](https://github.com/ghiouar/OfxDynamixel) to control Dynamixel servometors.
- [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) which allows face and human facial expression detection.

The robot is made up of 4 Dynamixel servomotors connected in series and a webcam representing the eye of the robot.

The project has a graphical interface developed with ofxGuiExetended which allows to control the robot and define new movements.
